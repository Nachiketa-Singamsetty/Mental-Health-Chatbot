Should I go and talk to that girl\\x92s parents? Should I go and talk to my husband\\x92s parents?

What I understood was that the husband felt he had not got love from others around him. In his wife he found a person to call his own and used abuse to show power and control over her. It was actually because he was insecure and possessive and he was in a lot of pain inside. When I explained this to the wife instead of hatred she was now filled with empathy. She said \\x91My husband was in pain all this while and I thought I was the one in pain.\\x92 This reality changed her and now they are healing each other.

              " '<START> The channels through which most of us look for happiness is interesting . It ranges from position possessions property relationships health and so on . Today if you ask someone what they want in life they say success . But they want success essentially because they believe it makes them happy . Likewise ask them why they own or purchase material comfort and the most likely response is that it makes them or their family happy . And the biggest reason people get into relationships today is to get that sense of happiness from the other person . So finally everyone is looking for just that one feeling \\x97 happiness . <END>',\n",

But the moment we make happiness dependent on something it becomes a fleeting emotion . Simply put if you look for happiness outside of you you are dependent on a situation to be favourable . Happiness now becomes conditional and fleeting . If I am happy only when the weather is pleasant my feeling good is dependent on the weather . I will not allow myself to feel nice if it gets hotter or colder . <END>',\n",

The equation has been \\x91 I am doing this so that I will feel happy \\x92 . Only when it \\x92 s done and done perfectly I can be happy . So the dependency is on the act being performed in the right manner . This belief is ingrained right from childhood . Parents feel good when the child gets good marks when the child performs well when the child dresses up well and so on . Slowly a child is conditioned to believe that he is responsible for his parents \\x92 happiness . If they are happy he can be happy too and not otherwise . <END>',\n",

This also means that 10 days down the line if the car gets a scratch or a bump my happiness is again going to get affected because I have conditioned myself into believing that it is the car that is giving me happiness . Now that is not true . You buy a new car \\x97 the most expensive car in the world . I feel comfortable sitting in the car . So who is experiencing the comfort ? It \\x92 s the body . Plush seats the best music system and a powerful AC . There is flawless physical comfort . I feel comfortable sitting in the car and tell myself that I am feeling good .

It doesn \\x92 t mean we don \\x92 t buy things ; it just means we don \\x92 t associate objects with our being happy . Let \\x92 s buy things for their utility or comfort not for happiness . I need clarity about why I buy something so that I don \\x92 t tell my mind it gives me happiness . If I associate material objects with happiness then I would only keep postponing happiness by putting new conditions . Suppose I am constructing a house . I tell myself that once the house is built and I shift there I will be happy . This could take a year or two so I postpone my happiness until a distant future . Think of a child \\x97 we look at the child in school and say childhood is the best phase of life but the child looks at grownups and says they are lucky for they don \\x92 t have projects or exams . The child is looking to be out of school so that he can be happy . He feels he will be very happy when he goes to a college . Then when he gets into a college he feels he will be happy once he starts earning and then marriage and then family . Even after all that he feels he can be happy once his children settle well . Few years down the line the children also settle well and everything is fine . What is his thought now ? He feels he will be very happy when he retires . So when will he actually be happy ? He kept postponing happiness to different stages of life and every time there was a new blank to fill in . This is how we get into a vicious circle : when this happens I will be happy . <END>',\n",

Now who is creating the response ? If the stimulus was creating the response then the stimulus will keep on creating the same response irrespective of a change in situation . Further if I show the same piece of jewellery to 10 people will all of them create the same thoughts ? Someone says \\x97 It \\x92 s too loud .

He makes that assessment based on my genetic factors my current lifestyle and on present health parameters . Going back home with the new information and I have two ways of responding . One \\x97 I start thinking \\x91 I will have diabetes it is sure to happen because my mother has it my grandmother has it I have so much stress my lifestyle is very erratic even the doctor has predicted .

I bring about a shift in my lifestyle . I start walking daily I do meditation pranayam and yoga . I change my food habits and sleep timings . I take care of my emotions and lead a healthy lifestyle . There is a big chance that I will never have diabetes . The doctor \\x92 s assessment will not come true in this case . It is all about how we respond to an assessment or prediction . There was a probability of my getting diabetes so that part was pure science . But it was still a probability not a reality .

But if I don \\x92 t take charge and I just accept the probability as an upcoming reality it is going to become the reality . I have accepted it already I have created anxiety and worry and so it is going to happen because the probability was already there . In the same way I go to an astrologer .

Do the planets change positions when we do that ? No they are still the same . But we are doing something that is helping us to change our thoughts . First we had the information that these 6 months would not go right for us and so we were demotivated . Now we have the information that if we wear this particular finger ring success is certain .

Just to ensure I don \\x92 t confront you right now . I postpone my external reaction . The internal reaction is there . But I resolve the issue internally and then decide how to respond .

If I had an interaction with you before if I had done business with you before I have a past experience . Every time I think of you my quality of thoughts will be based on those past experiences . If it had been a pleasant experience my mind creates nice thoughts . Second factor is information . Everything that I take in through my sense organs \\x97 what I read what I watch what I eat \\x97 everything that is going in has an effect on the mind . Information plays a vital role on the mind . The mind is very clean soon after waking in the morning after being well rested . So it is fresh and ready to create and ready to absorb . In the morning we usually read the newspaper or switch on news channels . This means we are reading listening and watching about terror violence natural calamities financial issues social and political upheaval and so on . The mind which is like a clean blotting paper absorbs this chaotic information . The kind of information will influence the thoughts . Information is the food thoughts are the resultant energy .

So if I want to take charge of my thoughts if I want to change the quality of my thoughts I will have to first change the quality of the raw material that goes in . During the first two hours of the morning the absorption power of the mind is very high . If we are reading watching and listening to negative content during this time though we want positive thinking from where and how is it going to happen ? Moreover suppose a child doesn \\x92 t return home on time in the evening and his phone is not reachable . It becomes so natural for parents to think that the child is in trouble .

No this is not natural . Natural is the child has not returned on time and they are unable to contact him . The situation is not in their control .

Let me just watch myself playing the role as a detached observer . I will just focus on my performance let me not look at the other actors in the scene no judgement or comment . I am looking at myself my response and my script in every scene . As a detached observer let me ask myself was there any scene that I could have performed differently ? Did I have another choice to the way I was writing my script ? Let me play the scene again on the screen of my mind same scene but a different me with a different script .

So every thought becomes very important . But what determines the quality of my thought ? Everyone is talking about positive thinking yet why does negative thinking come so naturally the minute there is a stimulus or a trigger ? The factors that determine the quality of our thoughts are past experiences and the information we consume . These two play a very important role in the quality of our thoughts . The third and the most important factor is our belief system . Our body is like a computer : I the soul is the operator and the belief system is our operating system .

The computer is important its operator is important but the operating system plays a huge role . At times a virus can attack the computer \\x92 s operating system and hampers functioning .

My responsibility is to not to question why the child is behaving like this but to see what is the pain within him that caused him to behave that way . Now if you go to his room and question his behaviour your child will request you to leave him alone .

He does not want to continue going through the hurt and pain and so he becomes loud and aggressive . Before anyone can say anything to him he tends to snap at them . People will start fearing him .
